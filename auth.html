<h2>What is AuthValues?</h2>
    <p>LeftValues is a quiz for Authortarians based upon the 8values quiz that seeks to identify your position as an Authortarian. If you are not Auth, this quiz is obviously not suited for you. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores.</p>

<h2>What are the values?</h2>
