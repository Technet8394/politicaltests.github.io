<h2>What is 9Axes+?</h2>
    <p>9axes+, based off of <a href="https://9axes.github.io/">9axes</a>, is a political quiz that tries to assign percentages on ten different political axes, in an attempt to improve the 9axes test. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!</p>
    <p>There are two versions of the quiz: a full version with 24 questions per axis, for a total of 216 questions, and a short version with 5 questions per axis, for a total of 45 questions. Feel free to take whichever.</p>
