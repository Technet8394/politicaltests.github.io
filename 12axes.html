<h2>What is 12axes?</h2>
    <p>12axes, based off of <a href="https://9axes.github.io/">9axes</a>, is a political quiz that tries to improve the 9axes test by reorganizing, improving, and patching errors within the test. It assigns your political beliefs in 12 different axes that are grouped in 4 different categories. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!</p>
    <p>There are two versions of the quiz: a full version with 24 questions per axis, for a total of 216 questions, and a short version with 5 questions per axis, for a total of 45 questions. Feel free to take whichever.</p>
